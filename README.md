- Python scripts for automation and data processing  
- Modular code structure  
- Easy-to-follow documentation  
- Designed for educational and practical use cases

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avimishragit/Avinash_Mishra_KCCQueryAssistant.git
   cd Avinash_Mishragit_KCCQueryAssistant
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the requirements:**
